# LSTM
Prediction of streamflow as a crucial source of hydrological information plays a central role in various fields of water projects.
Although streamflow forecasting on a daily basis with a reasonable level of accuracy is necessary, prediction based on limited
accessible data is beneficial not only in minimizing the computation time but also in early warning mechanisms for floods.
This study aims to improve Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) performance by Kalman filter (KF) for streamflow forecasting. For
this goal, the simulation has been specified according to the daily streamflow series for 60 years of Dez Dam, located in Iran. We
compared the results of simulating the LSTM, LSTM-KF, LSTM-UKF, LSTM-KFS, and LSTM-UKFS models. In addition, the
accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated with statistical analysis including Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), root-mean-
squared error (RMSE), average absolute relative error (AARE) and mean relative error (MAE). The results indicate the high capability
of the LSTM-UKFS model as a data-driven technique in flood forecasting application. This study also highlighted that the deep-
learning approach with a simple architecture has a promising capacity to predict the flood even in the presence of dams in the study area.
